React:
Components are the core of React. Everything in React is a component.
There are two ways to create a React component.
    1.Stateless Functional Component.
    To create a component with function,you simply write a Javascript function that
    return either JSX or null. 
    One important thing to note is that React requires your function name to begin with a "capital letter"

    const DemoComponent = function() {
        return (
            <div className ="customClass" />
        );
    };
