React:
Components are the core of React. Everything in React is a component.
There are two ways to create a React component.
    1.Stateless Functional Component.
    To create a component with function,you simply write a Javascript function that
    return either JSX or null. 
    One important thing to note is that React requires your function name to begin with a "capital letter"

The Example of Stateles Function Componet

    const DemoComponent = function() {
        return (
            <div className ="customClass" />
        );
    };


    2.Class syntex
    The other way to define a React component is with ES6 class syntex.

The Example ES6 Class

    class Kitten extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
        }

        render() {
            return (
                <h1>HI</h1>
            );
        }
    }
